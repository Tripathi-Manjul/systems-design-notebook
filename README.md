# Systems Design Notebook 📖⚙️

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A structured learning journey through system design fundamentals, combining theoretical concepts with practical implementations and real-world case studies.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Code-backed Theory**: Python implementations of core concepts 
- **Structured Learning**: Chapter-wise progression through DDIA and interview prep resources
- **Real-world Context**: Case studies from major platforms 
- **Interview Focus**: Design patterns and tradeoffs explained through actual system scenarios


## Why This Repository? 🎯

- 📚 **Bridging Theory & Practice**  
  Connects DDIA concepts to actual implementations (e.g., B-tree code + Jira case study)
  
- 🧠 **Interview Preparation Framework**  
  Structures learning path for system design interviews using Alex Xu's methodology
  
- ⚙️ **Code-Verified Concepts**  
  Python implementations validate theoretical understanding of data structures
  
- 🌍 **Real-World Validation**  
  Analyzes production systems to demonstrate theoretical concepts in action

## Contribution 🤝

While primarily a personal learning log, I welcome:

- Technical corrections to implementations
- Additional real-world case studies
- Well-researched optimizations
- Interview question suggestions

**Note:** Please create an issue before submitting PRs for significant changes.
